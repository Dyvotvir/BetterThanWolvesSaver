## 🕯️ The Problem
*Better Than Wolves* is brutal. You can survive for 40 hours, reach the Crucible stage, and then lose everything because of one mistake. The default "Hardcore" mode deletes your world instantly.

I realized that constantly manually zipping and unzipping world folders was tedious and broke my immersion. I needed a tool that let me treat death as a "Checkpoint" rather than a "Game Over."
